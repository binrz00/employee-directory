## employee-directory
This a react app that allows the user to view all employees and sort them in order to quickly access information. This homework is deployed on netlify at https://wizardly-roentgen-704caa.netlify.com/ I used the sort method to arrange the employees in the desired order and a map method to filter out undesired ages. future deployment includes more filters and options for sorting.
